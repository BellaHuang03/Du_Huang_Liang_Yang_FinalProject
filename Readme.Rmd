## Summary

Summary of the project: 
This project examines spatial and temporal patterns of U.S. renewable energy development from 2018 to 2023 using plant-level data from the EPA’s eGRID database. Focusing on wind, solar, and hydropower, the analysis combines time-series trends and spatial analysis to show growth in solar and wind, strong geographic clustering. In addition to that, early-adopting states, such as California and Texas, of these renewable energy continued to dominate in the energy production expansion. On the other hand, hydropower remains largely stable due to infrastructural and environmental constraints.

The main challenge was the size of the eGRID dataset and the fact that only one person could work in R at a time, which required the team to take turns during data processing and analysis. However, our group members worked in an organized way and communicated with each other efficiently. Our group project finished in a logical and smooth flow. With more time, this project could be expanded to include additional years of data and more detailed analyses of technology- and state-level trends.

## Keywords

Renewable energy; Solar; Wind; Hydro; eGRID; Time Series; Spatial Analysis; geographic cluster.

## Contribution

For the coding part, Yimei and Isabella worked on spatial analysis of this project, while Bella and Jingxin worked on time series and statistical analysis. All four group members worked evenly on the final write-up.

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

We have a data folder that contains all the processed and unprocessed data in the repository. 

There is also a Code folder, consisting of a number of rmd files including our data exploration, data processing and  data analysis. Our project was separated into two parts, one focused on spatial analysis, while the other one focused on time series and statistical analysis. Code files are separated between the two parts.

We only have a one data processing.Rmd file for Time Series analysis, since in our data processing, there are a few one-time codes, so we decided to keep all codes in one Rmd. However, we had clear bullet points and section titles to help ourselves keep the working space clean and efficient.
